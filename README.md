## Customization Tips

* **Background Gradient**: Change `.animation-area` linear-gradient colors.
* **Bubble Animations**: Adjust `@keyframes animate` or bubble `li` sizes/durations for different effects.
* **Glass Card**: Modify `backdrop-filter`, `border`, or `box-shadow` for stronger or subtler glassmorphism effect.
